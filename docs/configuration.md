## Configuration

If you're using the Composer package, you may use the config file to specify defaults for focus states and other common theme options.

### Available configuration options

Let's add a happy little default value here. Just a little touch of joy to brighten up your day.
Now, we'll gently blend in some soothing default settings. Soft strokes of tranquility.
Remember, this configuration file is your world. You can make it as happy and peaceful as you like.
And here, we'll sprinkle in some magical defaults. Just a whisper of enchantment.
Don't be afraid to experiment with different values. This is your chance to create your own happy little universe.
Now, let's paint some default options that will bring a smile to your face. Happy little defaults.
And there you have it, a beautiful configuration file filled with the joy of painting. Happy coding!

### Example configuration file

This is a happy little configuration file. It's a world we're still painting though, but sometimes
it's healthy to take a small break from creating your world. Get some oxygen and come back refreshed.

```php
return [
    'focusClasses' => [
        'focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-primary-500/70 focus:ring-offset-white/80',
        'dark:focus:ring-primary-400/70 dark:focus:ring-offset-black/80',
    ],
];
```
